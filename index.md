### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was one of my favorite labs since we used the iostream library
     in it to read informtion from text files. 
     My favorite part of the lab was using writing the function to determine if a word was a palindrome.
     Now that I know how to check to see if two words are palindromes, I can use that knowlage and apply it in oter programs, like writing a simlar program to deterine if a word is and anagram for anouther word.


* Lab 10 
  Part 3 of Lab 10 was my favorte labs becuase we worked with outputing images using C++.
  It taught me that I could combine skills that I had learned in pervous labs to print out a cool image.
  I learned how to use nested loops to change the information in a 2D container and print out informtion systematically
  With the informtion I learned from this lab I can manipulate 2D contaries better and I know how to output an image using the Magick library.
