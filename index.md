### CPSC 120

 
* Lab 6
 
   Lab 6, part 2 was one of my favorite labs since we were able to create an autonomous game after the code was written, since the only input required was by the person playing the game. This was amazing since it showed me how I could utilize while loops and how I could have a chain of if and else statements. The game we made helped me learn how to build a program to run unless it met a certain condition which is useful when I need to design a system that needs to run continuously until certain conditions.
 
* Lab 8
 
   Lab 8, part 1 was one of my favorite labs since we used the iostream library to read information from text files.
   My favorite part of the lab was using writing the function to determine if a word was a palindrome.
   Now that I know how to check to see if two words are palindromes, I can use that knowledge and apply it in other programs, like writing a similar program to determine if a word is and anagram for another word.
 
 
* Lab 10
 Part 3 of Lab 10 was my favorite lab because we worked with outputting images using C++.
 It taught me that I could combine skills that I had learned in previous labs to print out a cool image.
 I learned how to use nested loops to change the information in a 2D container and print out information systematically
 With the information I learned from this lab I can manipulate 2D contaries better and I know how to output an image using the Magick library.
